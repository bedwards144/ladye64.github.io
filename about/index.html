                    <h2>About the Creator</h2>
                    <p style="font-size:18px">Hi Everyone!!!!  My name is Cheryl Edwards.  I am married to my best friend, Duane, and we have two amazing sons, Brandon and Tyler and a furbaby Bandit.  I was a stay-at-home mom until our boys ventured out on their own...one to university, the other, to “spread his wings”.  While home with the kids I developed a love of all things homemade; baking, sewing, wood working. I love to create items that are unique but personal and express who we are.   Duane’s obsession with racing led me to my other passion...My Silhouette Cameo!!!</p>

                    <h2>About the Business</h2>
                    <p style="font-size:18px">I started My Vinyl Xpressions in May of 2015 when I found that making decals on my Silhouette Cameo was not only cheaper but way more fun!!!  From decals on our golf cart to wall decals in our home to making personalized wine glasses and coffee mugs for gifts...my little hobby grew into a small business.  In January of 2016 I was able to purchase a Heat Press which allows me to create custom t-shirts, sweatshirts and pillows with more ease than I could have imagined.</p>
